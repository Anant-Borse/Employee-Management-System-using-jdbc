# Employee-Management-System-using-jdbc
This Employee Management System is a basic Java application that demonstrates the use of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to manage employee records. It allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, which is stored in a relational database.

Features
Add New Employee: Insert a new employee record into the database.
View Employees: Retrieve and display a list of all employees.
Update Employee Information: Modify existing employee details.
Delete Employee: Remove an employee record from the database.
Search Employee: Find a specific employee using their ID or other attributes.

Technologies Used
Java SE: Core Java concepts and features.
JDBC: To connect and interact with the relational database.
SQL: For database queries and operations.
Maven: Project build and dependency management.

Configure the database:

Ensure you have a relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) set up.
Update the jdbc.properties file with your database credentials.
Build and run the project:

Use Maven to compile and package the application.
Run the Main class to start interacting with the Employee Management System.
Future Enhancements
Implementing a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
Adding authentication and role-based access control.
Integrating with a web application using Servlets and JSP.
